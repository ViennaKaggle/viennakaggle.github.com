This is the official blog of the [Vienna Kaggle Meetup][meetup] group.

## Who are we?

We are a group of motivated people who are passionate about learning, implementing, sharing and discussing machine learning algorithms for Kaggle competitions. We love to spend our nights breaking scores, tweaking algorithms and improving machine learning skills.

The Vienna Kaggle Meetup is organized by [Christoph Körner][linkedin-christoph] and [Stefan Kupstaitis-Dunkler][linkedin-stefan].

## What is Kaggle?

Kaggle is the world's largest community of data scientists. They compete with each other to solve complex data science problems, and the top competitors are invited to work on the most interesting and sensitive business problems from some of the world’s biggest companies through Masters competitions.
