We had a great [first Meetup][meetup-event] with our fantastic sponsor [Waytation][sponsor]. Here is a little summary about things that we discussed - the full slides can be found [here][slides].

Our motivation for the [Vienna Kaggle Meetup][meetup] is to gather with like-minded people, share and learn from each other. We love talks about Big Data and Machine Learning, but we prefer to get our hands dirty and do something. On [Kaggle][kaggle], we can find real datasets and real problems to solve. Paired with the competitions, the leaderboard and the active community this is a great place to gather practical experience. And when you get stuck in a competition, it is nice to have people around you to help.

The [Vienna Kaggle Meetup][meetup] will take place every 2-3 weeks with an alternating A/B Scheme. Scheme A is a pair programming session from 19h to max 23h, where we team up and code on competitions. Scheme B is a theory session from 19h - 21h, where we share and discuss insights, problems and solutions of the previous session. If we have time, we will also invite guest speakers to present Machine Learning theory.

The [next session][meetup-event-next] will be a Coding Session (Scheme A) and take place on November 19th 2015. Please vote for your [favorite competition][competition-form] and bring your laptops. Note, that this will be in 3 weeks, due to a collision with the [Visual Data Science Meetup][vds-meetup-event].

I want to make this Meetup awesome for everybody, so please give me [feedback][feedback-form] about the first Event (takes less than 30 seconds)!

If you want to be a co-organizer, please send me a message or leave a comment in the Meetup group! If you want to contribute to this blog, please send a [PR on Github][github].
