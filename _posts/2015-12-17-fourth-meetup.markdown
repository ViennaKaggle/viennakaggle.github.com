A couple of days ago we had our [fourth Meetup][meetup-event], and as you might already know we decided to only do coding session. This time the sponsor was our hosts company [GESIM][sponsor], who took care of pizza, coke and beer. After a short discussion we started to tackle the [Prudential Life Insurance competition][prudential-comp]. You can find our first steps on Github in the [Prudential repository][prudential-repo].

See you the next time,

Christoph
