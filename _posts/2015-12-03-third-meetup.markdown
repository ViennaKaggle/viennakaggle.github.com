A while ago we had our [third Meetup][meetup-event], again a coding session. This time the sponsor was our hosts company [GESIM][sponsor], who took care of pizza, coke and beer. It was a lot of fun, and we could make good progress in the [Rossmann competition][rossmann-comp], as usual you can find all our code on Github in the [Rossmann repository][rossmann-repo].

See you the next time,

Christoph
